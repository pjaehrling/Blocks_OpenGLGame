Blocks
======================
#### An OpenGL Game written in C/C++ 

I've done this as an university project in 2012.
Tested successful only under Linux with gcc. 
Errors compiling it with gcc under Windows.

To compile the sources run "$ make" (This will execute the Makefile provided with the repository).
To run the actual game run "$ ./blocksgame"

Sorry for the german source-comments. This was done for the professor and could be maybe be changed later. ;)

#### Usage:

	In the menu:
		- Arrow-Keys (up/down)	--> change the current selection
		- Enter					--> choose current selection

	In the actual game:
		- W/A/S/D		--> change the focused block
		- E 			--> change to "view-mode" (to turn around the view) and back to "play-mode"  
		- Q 			--> back to menu
		- Arrow-Keys	--> 1. (in "view-mode") --> turn the view around
						--> 2. (in "play-mode") --> mode the focused block
		- 1/2/3			--> change field texture
